Notes
Chem Conc Engine

* Main Clock / FB
  - update interval
    - variable (sub processes) ?

* chem 
  - 2d structure but expandable to (N`d)
  - chem structure + physical map
  - periodic table  = affiliation strengths?
  
  - active sites ??

* ?? active sites  ??
  ?? reactive site representation ? O-clash ???
    OK if O never matches O .. but not accept.
    Subsite matches.. (other chems active sites)
  - AS can be ANY / ALL .. 
  - each AS has physical map

* Cells 
  -  (isolated) mix of conc's
  - expandable & nestable (organelle's vs skeletal)
  - chem process (reactions)

* chem process
  - (core) has full access to cell energy + chems
  - expander class's 
    - (size,pos) - relative to parent cell ?
    - 
  - multiple match reactants (O),(A,B,C ..)
  - chem ops on cell

* chem ops (core)
  - conditional on (A,B,C ..) / cell.energy
  - scale on (A,B,C ..) / cell.energy
  - split (ABCD)= AD+BC
  - join  (A,B,C..) = ABC.. (or ACB?)
  - endo (J)/exo (S) thermic? (energy not tempÂ’)

TODO 1. chem structure
 -----------------------------
  - 2d but expandable to (N`d)
  - chem structure 
  - physical map  
    - periodic table  = affiliation strengths?
  
  - active sites (representation) ??
    - each AS has physical (sub) map
 
  - multiple match reactants (O),(A,B,C ..)
  - chem ops on cell
